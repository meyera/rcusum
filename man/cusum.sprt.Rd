\usage{
  cusum.sprt(failure_indicator, p0, OR, alpha = 0.01,
    beta = 0.01, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{failure_indicator}{a numeric indicator variable
  consiting of only \code{c(0,1)}, where 0 is no failure
  and 1 is failure for each procedure}

  \item{p0}{a numeric vector representing the acceptable
  risk score/acceptable failure rate for each single
  individual. I.e. STS Score values, or emperically modeled
  risks}

  \item{OR}{the increase in relative risk to the modeled
  acceptable risk, where An odds ratio of 2, for example,
  would equate approximately to a doubling of
  patientspecific risk of failure, an odds ratio of 1.5 to
  a 50 percent increase in failure risk, and so on.}

  \item{alpha}{Type I error (the probability of concluding
  that the failure rate has increased, when in fact it has
  not)}

  \item{beta}{Type II error (the probability of concluding
  that the failure rate has not increased, when in fact it
  has)}

  \item{by}{a factor vector consisting of the
  stratification variable.}

\value{

\description{
  Implementation of a risk-adjusted sequential probability
  ratio test (SPRT) chart with control limits as described
  in Rogers et al. (2004)
}
\details{
  For the unadjusted chart, increase in risk is defined in
  terms of the unacceptable failure rate. However, when
  risk for each patient varies, it does not make sense to
  have a common unacceptable rate applied across all
  operations. This variable unacceptable rate is achieved
  by defining the increase in terms of a relative risk (ie.
  odds ratio), rather than a specific rate.
