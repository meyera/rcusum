\title{Creats a cusum chart and cusum log-likelihood chart}
\usage{
  cusum(failure_indicator, p0, p1, alpha = 0.01,
    beta = 0.01, by = NULL, loglike_chart = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{failure_indicator}{a numeric indicator variable
  consiting of only \code{c(0,1)}, where 0 is no failure
  and 1 is failure for each procedure}

  \item{p0}{a constant representing the fixed acceptable
  event rate when the process is in control}

  \item{p1}{a constant representing the fixed unacceptable
  event rate we want to detect}

  \item{alpha}{Type I error (the probability of concluding
  that the failure rate has increased, when in fact it has
  not)}

  \item{beta}{Type II error (the probability of concluding
  that the failure rate has not increased, when in fact it
  has)}

  \item{by}{a factor vector consisting of the
  stratification variable.}

  \item{loglike_chart}{a flag controling which kind of
  chart will be shown}
}
\value{
  an object of the class \code{ggplot}
}
